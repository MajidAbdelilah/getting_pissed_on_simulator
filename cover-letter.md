Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineering position at your company. With over 11 years of programming experience and a proven track record of developing high-performance applications, I am confident in my ability to make significant contributions to your team.

My journey in programming began at age 13 with a simple ambition: to create HTML games. Though my first game didn't gain traction, the experience ignited a passion for coding that has only grown stronger. Over the years, I've mastered multiple programming languages and technologies, including C/C++, Python, JavaScript, and specialized in both game development and web applications.

What sets me apart is my dedication to pushing technical boundaries. When I wanted to impress potential employers, I didn't just learn existing technologiesâ€”I built my own. Most recently, I developed a GPU-Accelerated 3D Particle System using SYCL that efficiently simulates over 1,000,000 particles in real-time with 56 FPS. My rendering engine "Gabriel" achieved 385% better performance than Godot, and my optimization work on the open-source Physics3D project improved its performance by 25%. These achievements demonstrate not just technical skill, but my commitment to excellence.

Currently, I'm applying my entrepreneurial spirit to SAMMA.app, a marketplace for Arabic indie games built with modern web technologies. This project showcases my ability to handle full-stack development, from frontend UI with React to backend integration with Supabase, including authentication systems and cloud infrastructure management.

At 1337 coding school, I consistently rank among the top students, finishing the common core curriculum second among 300+ peers. My projects regularly exceed evaluation standards, receiving scores of 115-125/100.

I bring to the table not just technical expertise, but also the initiative to solve complex problems, a proven ability to optimize systems, and experience working both independently and collaboratively. I'm eager to bring these qualities to your team and contribute to your company's success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience align with your needs.

Sincerely,

Abdelilah Majid
